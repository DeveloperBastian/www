# Thoughts
*	Gameplay Abilities are essential for modern Unreal game development as they decouple pawn from actions. This allows for modular development and avoids blown up character BPs
*	In this tutorial, we focus on how to bind abilities to your Pawn class via a Lyra Ability Set. Furtermore, we dive shortly into the Enhanced Input System to extend the Lyra input bindings with a framework for localized, plugin specific bindings
