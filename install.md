# Thoughts

As promised, we will not use any C++ coding in our approach. Still, we need to have a working coding environment in place for several reasons
*	Lyra needs to recompile quite often and stumbles if there is not environment available
*	we want to debug workflows to understand how different parts of Lyra are connected
*	we **will** come to a point where defining a new functionality is easier in coding than Blueprints - but at that point we will have learned enough to know what we are doing (fingers crossed...)
