## Mixamo to Unreal Manny - including root motion and footsteps: Fastest and easiest process
*	We use a free [software](https://terribilisstudio.fr/) from to import Mixamo Animations directly to the Unreal 5.2 Manny Skeleton without any retargeting work to do in Unreal.
*	This is fast and easy - and fixes problems with root motion and finger/hand bones automatically.
*	Furthermore, we explore how to add visual and audio effects to footsteps using Lyra's Animation Data Modifier and look how footsteps are steered through different surface information.

*	Cudos to Adobe(R) - the [license](https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/faq/mixamo-faq.html) for Mixamo animations is extremely open in usage and it is a great source for starting our animation journey
