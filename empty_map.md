# Targets of this tutorial
*	Creating a new [Gamefeature plugin](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.1/en-US/game-features-and-modular-gameplay-in-unreal-engine/)
*	Creating an Open World map
*	Setting up a character derived from Lyra 

Its important that we never modify anything in the Lyra folder itself (as it will change over the versions), but just remain in our plugin folder to start building a world.

# Outcome
Working empty map with a single character using Lyra movements.

*	Make sure to never modify anything in the Lyra /Content folder
*	Make sure to control all dropdown menues after pasting in code from [BlueprintUE](https://blueprintue.com/profile/devbastian/) - they tend to reset to default
