# Thoughts
*	Lyra uses a two layer menu that looks for Lyra User Facing Experience Definitions in the search paths and adds it automatically to the first layer menu
*	We slim that down to a single step approach - but still use the components to integrate into Lyra if that is your goal later
*	We use a lot of grafical component from Lyra - here you definitely want to modify them to your own style
*	The option menu from Lyra is extensive - so be glad to not having to rebuild this!

# Steps (referring to infographic letters)
*	L-Q: 	Build a new level that acts as entry level and only shows the startup screen and menu
*	R-S:	Reuse the Lyra in-game menu
