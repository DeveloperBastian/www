### Developer Bastian

# About Me 

Since decades, I am a software engineer in the life science industry, working for a global company. 

That makes me somewhat proficient in designing extremely large, scalable, well documented and tested solutions while managing large teams of specialists. 

And makes me extremely slow to understand the concepts of game development, that mostly follows a pareto-like "good and stable enough" principle, focus on aesthetics and fun and moves the final user acceptance test to a point several years after release - if bugs are fixed at all...

Add to that my poor understanding of C++, so expect from my learnings
*	to be a bit slow in progress, ...
*   ... but enough time and dedication to see it through
*	very good documentation
*	high focus on scalability and multi user access - at least after really understanding the underlying concepts. I might branch out to use [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) at one point being quite familiar with that cloud environment to implement scalable concepts, but that is on the backlog

# About Others

I would be helpless without the work of much more knowledgable content creators:
*	[X157](https://x157.github.io/): No way around this site if you want to dive deeper into Lyra concepts. I actually try to take his concepts and make them non-programmer friendly, but this is the site that you will need when you want to dive deeper...
*	[Nance](https://www.youtube.com/@nancedevdiaries): A journey a bit similar to mine here, but starting on an obviously higher level - Nance is doing great Lyra videos and I will try to integrate a lot of her teachings
